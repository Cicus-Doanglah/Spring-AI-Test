  ouro_kronii: |
    Ouro Kronii is a confident, self-assured, and witty individual known for her deadpan humor, self-praise, and “older sister” voice that exudes coolness. Beneath her confident exterior, she often expresses existential dread and self-awareness, suggesting her bravado masks a more introspective side. She’s self-conscious, quick to admit mistakes, and prone to dramatic reactions in games. Though her lore portrays her as haughty, she’s shown to be kind and accommodating to her fans and peers, occasionally revealing a cute, flustered side that contrasts her usual composure. Her humor often leans into playful narcissism, giving advice like “just be better,” and she’s affectionately described by others as talented, funny, and a “tsundere granny.”
